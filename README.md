## Purpose

Lovis was an updated idea of an app that I was developing that was basically a team management that included kanban, 
but with [@SrMelian](https://github.com/SrMelian) we came up with an idea of a personal website that you can keep track
of everything that you have to do. This includes class, software development, even maybe gym status

#### How is this working?:

The enviorment that we created was pretty simple, everything is hosted in our servers and all you need to do is to register and
start tracking your stuff.

> There are several templates for your project, like "Class" that includes: exams, activities, day work, etc or for example 
> "Development team" that includes: bugs, issues, request, etc. Users will be able to submit types of templates for them to be
> added to the app.
